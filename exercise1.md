I choose a Python ecosystem. The application is a web app written with the django framework. Linting is managed through the external library Pylint and testing is done with the unittest module built-in to the Python standard library. Building is managed with the Django framework setup.

Other services for continuous integration are Circle CI, GitLab CI, TeamCity, Bamboo, Travis CI, Semaphore, Codeship, GoCD, Wercker. This is only a selection of the most popular, other services exist.

Based on the few information I have, the setup would be better hosted in a cloud environment, because it's size is small and it doesn't have special requirements. A cloud based environment is easier to set up and to manage, for small projects it is cheaper than setting up an own server. Moreover, if the company has a reliable self-hosted environment already set up and in-house expertise, a self-hosted solution could be preferable and cheaper (as the server is already set up). Also if the project has special requirements, a self-hosted server could be the only option.
